# ETHGlobal_Bangkok_2024_AI_Agents_Voting

# Votr
Your voice, your choice, your DAO.

## Summary
Votr empowers DAO members through AI-powered voting delegates that learn your preferences and values. Never miss a crucial proposal again - let your personalized AI agent represent your voice in DAO governance while staying true to your principles.

## Problem & opportunity
Participation in DAO governance is often low due to complex processes, time constraints, and information overload. Many members struggle to stay informed and actively engage in voting, leading to decisions that may not reflect the collective interests of the community.

Votr addresses these challenges by automating and simplifying governance participation. By leveraging AI agents that learn user preferences, Votr ensures that every memberâ€™s voice is represented. This creates a more inclusive, efficient, and impactful DAO ecosystem, empowering users to engage effortlessly while driving better decision-making outcomes.

## User Flow
The customer journey for user that wants to use agents for voting will be like this:
- User signs up for the service or login with existing wallet
- Onboarding process
- Teach agent about preferences
- Make changes

## Future Work
Some thoughts for how the whole project can be built out further:
- Truly autonomous mode for the AI agents
- Link to DAO governance and forums
- Integrate with ENS
